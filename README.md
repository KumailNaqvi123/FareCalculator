# Fare-Calculator
A C++ project to calculate the fare for a trip to various destinations. The fare is calculated based on the distance, time, night surcharge, and traffic delay surcharge.

## Features

- Generates random distances for a list of destinations.
- Calculates the fare based on:
  - Base fare
  - Cost per kilometer
  - Cost per minute
  - Night surcharge
  - Traffic delay surcharge
- Displays trip details and calculated fare.

## Installation

To compile and run the program, you need a C++ compiler. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KumailNaqvi123/fare-calculation.git
    cd fare-calculation
    ```

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. For example, using any compiler:
3. Run the compiled program:

## Usage

1. When you run the program, it will display a list of destinations with randomly generated distances.
2. You will be prompted to enter a number corresponding to your desired destination.
3. The program will then generate random trip details, including time, whether it's night time, and whether there's a traffic delay.
4. The program calculates and displays the total fare based on these details.
